# Potato.js

The JavaScript Library that turn complicated code into something more joyful.<br>

<P>potato javascript is the another way of coding the web application.<br> 
It extend the HTML code with custom tag.
It group the relevant code into one location (a html tag) to make the code much easier to maintain<br> 
and to let you write less code and keep your code simple to save your time on building application.</P>
<P>It is easy to learn and use and master.<br>

# Getting Started

</P>
<P>The basic syntax of the code is looked like this:</P>
<PRE><CODE>< <I>[<b>system name</b>]</I>-<I>[<b>object type</b>]</I>-<I>[<b>object id</b>]</I>  <I>[attribute1 attribute2...]</I> /></CODE></PRE>
<P>
For example if you want to create a button to alert out "my potato button" you just write the following code on the html document:
</P>
<PRE><CODE>&ltpotato-button-buttonID
    value="Click Me"
    background="yellow"
    marginTop="10px"
    image="image/img-p.png 21 21"
    onclick="alert('my potato button)"
&gt &lt/potato-button-buttonID&gt
</CODE></PRE>
    
<p>※You can use the keyword "potato" or just "o" as the [system name] for example < o-button-mybutton /> also will do.
I call it <b>OButton</b></p> 
<p>Example 2: Create a text box object with input keypad (i.e. <b>OKeypad</b>)
<PRE><CODE>&ltpotato-keypad-okeypad 
    marginTop=-15px					    
    value="0"
    top=-220px
    left=-150px			    
    htm="htm/keypad.htm"
&gt&lt/potato-keypad-okeypad&gt
</CODE></PRE>

# Authors

I am K.S.LIM the author,
I graduated from engineering background (Mechanical Engineering at Coventry University UK), but my final year project had led me to the world of programming. (Developing software to find the natural frequency and damping factor from the input data as provided from some vibration measurement device.) This is my final year’s undergraduate project. It combined the fields of engineering and programming.
The result was good and encouraged me continue to develop my programming skill until now.
This is my first JavaScript Library, which was developed since year 2010.

I call it <b>potato javascript</b> or o script (o=potato, why because its as easy as potato)
