# potato.js
The JavaScript Library that turn boring, repetitive code into something more joyful.
I am K.S.LIM the author, 
I graduated from engineering background (Mechanical Engineering at Coventry University UK in year 1999), but my final year project had led me to the world of programming. Developing software to find the natural frequency and damping factor from the input data as provided from some vibration measurement device. That is my final yearâ€™s undergraduate project. It combined the fields of engineering and programming. 
The result was good and encouraged me continue to develop my programming skill until now.
This is my first JavaScript Library, which was developed since year 2010. I call it potato.js

This library use the customized tag and customized attributes to let you
 create an object (fully functioning html element) via "fill in the blanks" on the html tag.
 Making accessibiity easy to learn and use and master. 

The basic syntax of the code is looked like this:
< [system name]-[object type]-[object id]  [attribute1 attribute2...] />
