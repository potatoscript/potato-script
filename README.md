JavaScript Library
I am LIM, I hate the boring, repetitive task and like to automate it into something more joyful.
I graduated from engineering background (Mechanical Engineering with First Class degree in Coventry University UK in year 1999), but my final year project had led me to the world of programming. Developing software to find the natural frequency and damping factor from the input data as provided from some vibration measurement device. That is my final yearâ€™s undergraduate project. It combined the fields of engineering and programming. 
The result was good and encouraged me continue to develop my programming skill until now.
This is my first JavaScript Library created from year 2015. I call it potato.js
